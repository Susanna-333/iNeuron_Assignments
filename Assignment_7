ASSIGNMENT - 7

Q.1.	Create two int type variables, apply addition, subtraction, division and multiplications and store the results in variables. Then print the data in the following format by calling the variables:
First variable is		& second variable is     .
Addition: __ + __ = __  	
Subtraction:	__	-	__ = __
Multiplication:	__ *	__	=	__
Division: __	/	__ = 	__

A.1. Code:
	a=20
	b=3
	add = a+b
	sub = a-b
	div = a/b
	mul = a*b
	print(”First variable is ",a," & second variable is ",b)
	print("Addition:",a,"+",b,"=",add)
	print("Subtraction:",a,"-",b,"=",sub)
	print("Division:",a,"/",b,"=",div)
	print("Multiplication:",a,"*",b,"=",mul)



Q.2.	What is the difference between the following operators:
(i)	‘/’ & ‘//’
(ii)	‘**’ & ‘^’

ANS:  (i) ‘/’ and ‘//’ both are Arithmetic Operators. 
	‘/’ is Division Operator. It performs division operation between two operands.
	For eg. 
a=20
	            b=3
		print( a / b )

	      o/p: 6.66666667

	‘//’ is Floor Division Operator. It performs floor division operation between two operands (eliminates the fractional value).
	For eg. 
a=20
	            b=3
		print( a // b )

	      o/p: 6

		(ii) ‘**’  is an Arithmetic Operator whereas ‘^’ is an Bitwise Operator  
	‘**’ performs exponential operation where frist number is base to power times of second number 
For eg.
	a = 2**5
	o/p = 32 -----------> a= 2*2*2*2*2

	‘^’ performs bitwise XOR operation where the output is 1 if either of the input is 1 else false
X	Y	X^Y
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0

	 

Q.3.	List the logical operators.

  ANS:  i) and operator 
	  ii) or operator
	  iii) not operator

Q.4.	Explain right shift operator and left shift operator with examples.

ANS:  
Right shift operator moves the bit values of a binary object to the right for given number of times.
For eg, 
a=9>>2  
9=> 1001
Moving bits to the right 2 times gives 0010
So a= 9>>2 = 2
Left shift operator moves the bit values of a binary object to the left for given number of times.
For eg,
 a=9<<2  
 9 => 1001
 Moving bits to the left 2 times gives 100100
 So a= 9<<2 = 36

Q.5.	Create a list containing int type data of length 15. Then write a code to check if 10 is present in the list or not.

ANS: Code:
List1 = [ 1, 5, 12, 7 ,10, 9, 11, 12, 3, 2, 8, 9, 4, 0, 11 ]
if 10 in List1:
	print(“10 is present in list”)
else:	
	prsint(“10 is not present in list”)
