ASSIGNMENT - 2

1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

ANS:  True and False are two values of the boolen data types. They are keywords and case sensitive.
For eg. 
a=True
            print (not a)
             False

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

ANS: The three differnt types of Boolean operators in python are: or and not
           For eg.  
a=1
            b=0
            print(a and b)
            print(a or b)
            print(not b)

O/P  0
            1
            1







3. Make a list of each Boolean operator & truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

A.3 i) and Operator:
        True and True is True
        True and False is False
        False and True is False
        False and False is False
    ii) or operator:
        True and True is True
        True and False is True
        False and True is True
        False and False is False
    iii) not Operator:
        True not is False
        False not is True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

ANS:  (5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
   	> False

             not (5 > 4)
             > False


(5	> 4) or (3 == 5)
> True

             not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
            > False

            (True and True) and (True == False)
             > False

            (not False) or (not True)
             > True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

ANS: The Six comparision operators are == , != , < , > , <= , =>

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

ANS: ‘==’ is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is that assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.
    For eg. 
      a = 10
                  if a == 10:
                  print(Equals)
                  print(a)

      O/P  Equals
                  10



7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

ANS:  spam = 0
            if spam == 10:
            print('eggs')     => Block1

            if spam > 5:
            print('bacon')    => Block2

            else:
            print('ham')
            print('spam')     => Block3
            print('spam')       









8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

A.8 Code:
    def spamCode(spam):
        if spam==1:
            print('Hello')
        elif spam==2:
            print('Howdy')
        else:
            print('Greetings')
    spamCode(1) 
    spamCode(2)
    spamCode(3)

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?

ANS: Press Ctrl+C to stop a program stuck in an infinite loop

10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

ANS:  Break statement - move the execution outside the loop if condition is satisfied.
Continue statement - move the execution to the start of the loop.

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

ANS: range(10) - range from 0 to 9 (10 exclusive)
          range (0,10) - indicates to start from 0 to 9
          range(0,10,1) - indicates to increase the variable by 1 on each iteration

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

ANS: Code:
        #Using Foro loop
        for i in range(1,11):
            print(i, end=" ")

        #Using While loop
        i=1
        while i<=10:
            print(i, end=" ")
            i+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

ANS:  spam.bacon()
