	Homo_tuple = (1,2,3….)

Q.8.	Explain the mutable and immutable data types with proper explanation & examples.

ANS: Mutable means can be edited after creation whereas Immutable cannot be edited. 
		Mutable data types – Lists, Dictionaries and Sets
			Immutable data types – Tuples

ANS: 

def triangle (n):
s = n – 1
for i in range (0,n):
for j in range (0,s):
print (end = “ “)
s = s – 1
for j in range (o,i * 2 – 1):
print (“*”,end=””)
print (“\r”)


n = 6
triangle (n)
