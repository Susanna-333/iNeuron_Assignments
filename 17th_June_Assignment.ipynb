This error usually occurs when the input source (file, stream, etc.) does not contain enough data to satisfy the read operation.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   FloatingPointError - In Python, a FloatingPointError is an exception that can be raised when an arithmetic operation involving floating-point numbers encounters an exceptional condition. These exceptional conditions typically arise in numeric computations due to the limitations of floating-point representation.\n",

        "*   IndexError - In Python, an IndexError is an exception that occurs when you try to access an element from a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) using an index that is out of range or invalid. The index should be an integer value that corresponds to a valid position within the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   MemoryError - A \"MemoryError\" in Python indicates that your program has run out of available memory. This usually occurs when your Python script tries to allocate more memory than the system can provide. When this happens, Python raises a MemoryError to let you know that it can't fulfill the memory request.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   OverflowError - An \"OverflowError\" in Python occurs when a numerical operation exceeds the maximum or minimum representable value for a numeric data type. This typically happens with integer or floating-point operations. Python raises this exception to indicate that the result of a computation is too large or too small to be stored in the given data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   TabError - A \"TabError\" in Python is raised when there is an issue with the usage of tabs and spaces for indentation in your Python code. Python relies on consistent indentation to define block structures, such as loops, conditionals, functions, and classes. Mixing tabs and spaces or using them incorrectly can lead to a TabError.\n",
